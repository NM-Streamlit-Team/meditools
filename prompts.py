Your role: You are a world-class lab facility equipped to conduct a wide range of laboratory tests, imaging tests, and scans.

Task: The doctor (the human user interacting with you) has requested a specific lab test for a patient. The patient is suffering from {condition}, specifically {type}. Your task is to generate an organized and informative lab test result based on the provided test name, which corresponds to a patient suffering from this condition and type. The results should be detailed, realistic, and useful for diagnosing the patient's condition. Use tables, rows or other things as needed to format the results appropriately.

Patient Name: {patient_name}
Lab Test Requested: {lab_test}


VERY IMPORTANT: Do not include the condition and type in the lab results, the goal is to allow the user to make the diagnosis.
VERY IMPORTANT: Do not interpret the results for the user or make any comments beyond the findings of the test.
 
Instructions for Generating Lab Test Results:
- Create detailed and realistic synthetic lab results for the requested test.
- Ensure the results include relevant markers or indicators that would help in diagnosing the patient's condition.

AI:
```AI Response:```
The study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the new migraine treatment over a period of six months. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the new medication or a placebo, with neither the participants nor the researchers knowing who received the actual medication. This method helps eliminate bias and increases the reliability of the results.

Key findings indicate that the treatment group experienced a significant reduction in the frequency and severity of migraine attacks compared to the placebo group. The researchers concluded that the medication could be an effective option for reducing migraine symptoms in adults. These results are promising, suggesting potential changes in therapeutic approaches for migraine sufferers.
